Computation using MATHEMATICA 
===============================================

This is a collection of notebook files and packages for use with
[MATHEMATICA](http://www.wolfram.com/).

-   [arbitrary\_weight\_rule](arbitrary_weight_rule/arbitrary_weight_rule.html),
    a program which accepts a formula for an arbitrary (but nonnegative)
    weight function over an interval, and determines the points and
    weights of a corresponding Gaussian quadrature rule, by Fukuda,
    Katsuya, Alt and Matveenko.
-   [buckling\_spring](buckling_spring/buckling_spring.html), a program
    which illustrates solutions of the buckling spring equations.
-   [burgers\_characteristics](burgers_characteristics/burgers_characteristics.html),
    a program which solves the time dependent inviscid Burgers equation
    using the method of characteristics, by Mikel Landajuela.
-   [calendars](calendars/calendars.html), a library which computes
    simple calendrical quantities, including the number of days elapsed
    between two dates.
-   [collatz](collatz/collatz.html), a program which reads an integer
    from the user and computes the Collatz sequence based on that
    integer.
-   [duel\_simulation](duel_simulation/duel_simulation.html) a program
    which simulates N repetitions of a duel between two plaers, each of
    whom has a known firing accuracy.
-   [felippa](felippa/felippa.html), a library which defines quadrature
    rules for lines, triangles, quadrilaterals, pyramids, wedges,
    tetrahedrons and hexahedrons.
-   [filum](filum/filum.html), a library which can work with information
    in text files.
-   [frobenius](frobenius/frobenius.html), a library which is useful for
    the Froebenius problem, also known as the postage stamp problem.
-   [graphics\_examples](graphics_examples/graphics_examples.html),
    programs which illustrate how various kinds of data can be displayed
    and analyzed graphically.
-   [lorenz\_equations](lorenz_equations/lorenz_equations.html), a
    program which demonstrates how solutions to the Lorenz equations can
    be synchronized.
-   [mathematica](mathematica/mathematica.html), a directory of examples
    which illustrate features of the Mathematica language.
-   [mhd\_control\_movie](mhd_control_movie/mhd_control_movie.html), a
    program which displays and animates the output data from a magnetic
    hydrodynamic control problem.
-   [newton\_cotes](newton_cotes/newton_cotes.html), a program which
    calls Mathematica functions to determine the points and weights for
    Newton-Cotes quadrature rules.
-   [quadrule](quadrule/quadrule.html), a library which evaluates
    certain quadrature rules needed by the C, C++, FORTRAN90 and MATLAB
    versions of QUADRULE.
-   [semicircle\_integrals](semicircle_integrals/semicircle_integrals.html),
    a program which evaluates the integral of a function *f(x,y)* over
    the unit semicircle -1 \<= x \<= +1, 0 \<= y \<= sqrt ( 1-x\^2).
-   [struveh](struveh/struveh.html), a library which evaluates the
    Struve H function.
-   [test\_values](test_values/test_values.html), a library which
    computes a few selected values of various mathematical functions.
-   [timestamp](timestamp/timestamp.html), a library which returns the
    YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
-   [uniform](uniform/uniform.html), a library which computes elements
    of a uniform pseudorandom sequence.
